● As the only computer engineering student, organized the other three electrical engineering
students in designing an Object Characteristics Detection and Sorting Project that determines object
characteristics.
● Programmed the Raspberry Pi controller board to automatically sense objects and use image
processing techniques to determine their physical characteristics in Python on a Linux-based OS in
less than one second for each object.
● Led other team members in their tasks involving programming and interfacing the controller board
with external circuitry.
